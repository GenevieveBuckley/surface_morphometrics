segmentation_values: # The value used to represent each feature, and the name of the feature.
  - 1: OMM
  - 2: IMM

surface_generation:
  simplify: True # You should not turn this off. Non-simplified surfaces can be VERY slow and there is no real benefit.
  max_triangles: 150000 # if more than this number of triangles are generated, the surface is decimated to this number
  extrapolation_voxels: 1 # More extrapolation will fill in larger holes, but can cause issues due to curling on the edges. Also, sometimes the holes are real and interesting.
  point_weight: 0.7 # Smaller numbers have stronger weight towards fitting segmented points, larger numbers have stronger weight towards generating a smooth surface
  neighbor_count: 70 # Should not need to adjust this, but I am exposing it as a tuning variable. Values over 50 seem to all be equivalently good...
curvature_measurements:
  radius_hit: 12 # This corresponds to the radius of the smallest feature of interest, roughly, for neighborhood determination. 8-15 seems to be a good range for mitochondria
distance_measurements:
  mindist: 3
  maxdist: 400
  tolerance: 0.1
  intra: # Intra-surface distance measurements
    - IMM
    - OMM
    - ER
  inter: # Intersurface distance measurements. Writes out symmetrically so no extra bits are needed.
